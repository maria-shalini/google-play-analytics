## Data Preprocessing

Raw datasets used:
- Play Store Data.csv
- User Reviews.csv

A preprocessing script (`preprocessing/preprocess_data.py`) was created to:
- Clean numeric and date fields
- Normalize installs, size, and price
- Aggregate user review sentiment
- Merge both datasets on App name

The processed output (`cleaned_apps.csv`) is used by all dashboard tasks.
